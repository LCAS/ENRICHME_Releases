NCP event server for ROS

This server allows to publish events into NCP. Clients only have to fill
event data and request operation to service (see event msg and srv definitions).

A simple client for this service is also provided.

This is still a work in progress. We need to define Types of events and 
confirm this code works against a working REST interface.
